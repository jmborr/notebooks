Thus I propose to lay the fake tubes at the same distance from the sample than the diffraction tubes, that is, the fake tubes will be laid on the inner surface of the BASIS tank. This should  produce a view of both the diffraction and indirect tubes pleasing to the eye. I will make sure the tubes diameter is such that there are no gaps between adjacent tubes, so that we can dispense with the black gaps currently showing around each detector.\n",
