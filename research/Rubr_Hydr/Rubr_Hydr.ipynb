      "<font size=\"1\"><pre>Here is the approach we use: run cpptraj with the \"pdb multi\" option on the trajout line.  This will create a set of PDB files.  You then have to add the \"CRYST1\" record from the experimental file at the top.  Then you can feed this pdb file to SFALL (from CCP4; other xray programs might work) to create the electron density map for that snapshot.  Do this for each snapshot, and average all the resulting maps to get an averaged electron density.\n",
      "This procedure is automated in the \"md2map.sh\" script which is in $AMBERHOME/AmberTools/src/xtalutil/Analysis.  Look at the comments at the top of this file.  It requires CCP4 programs to be in your PATH, and may require some work to make things work (this is all pretty new, even to us.)\n",
      "If your simulations is a constant volume one (using, presumably, the experimental unit cell parameters), you can try the somewhat simpler mdv2map.sh script in the same directory.\n",
      "...hope this helps...note that \"support\" for these scripts may be weaker than for other parts of Amber...so far as I know, only a very few people have used these.  We'll try to answer questions, but you may have to fiddle with things.\n",
      "I'll bet there must be other approaches that take a set of PDB files and compute electron density maps from them...doesn't have to have anything to do with Amber.  But I have to admit I didn't find anything with a simple Google search.  You might post a question on the CCP4 mailing list -- James Holton might reply, but he is the main author of md2map.sh.\n",
      "[Aside: sander knows how to deal with electron density maps, and how to create them from coordinates.  But this is in the context of cryo-EM maps, and does not know about crystal symmetry.  So that seems not much help for you, but just to point out to other readers an approach for the non-periodic problem.]\n",
